M100-Potsdam-2014
=================

I created this page to introduce myself to the other fellows in a creative way, as we were asked to do before arrival to Potsdam for [M100 Young European Journalists programme 2014](http://m100-data-community.m100potsdam.org/main/index).
Check [the page](bit.ly/1zmr7IR) - it has some Tableau infographics illustrating the demographics of M100 YEJ fellows 2014.  

I also invite you to read our [data story about arms trade during three big conflicts in the Middle East](bit.ly/1E8xD5P). This was the final project me and my team delivered at the end of the fellowship. I was responsible for building the three scatter plots in Tableau as well as for overall content planning.

Looking forward for your comments! For instance, on Twitter to @krystinashveda referring to [bit.ly/1E8xD5P](bit.ly/1E8xD5P).
