M100-Potsdam-2014
=================

I made this page for personal introduction to the other fellows, before we all met in Potsdam for [M100 Young European Journalists programme 2014](http://m100-data-community.m100potsdam.org/main/index)

The page has some graphics illustrating the demographics of our team.  
Check the [M100 YEJ 2014 intro](bit.ly/1zmr7IR) page to see the demographics of fellows 2014.

Read our [data story about arms trade during three big conflicts in the Middle East](bit.ly/1E8xD5P). This is the final project me and my team delivered as the result of the fellowship.
I was responsible for building the three scatter plots in Tableau as well as the overall planning of the project.
