M100-Potsdam-2014
=================

I made this page for personal introduction to the other fellows, before we all met in Potsdam for [M100 Young European Journalists programme 2014](http://m100-data-community.m100potsdam.org/main/index)

The page has some graphics illustrating the demographics of our team.  
The **intro page** can be found here: http://krystinashveda.com/M100-Potsdam-2014/

The **final project** me and my team delivered as the result of the fellowship can be found here: http://m100-workshop.com/projects/project_militaryTradeNew.html
It's a data story about arms trade during three big conflicts in the Middle East.
