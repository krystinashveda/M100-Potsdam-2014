As we are all data journalists, let us rely on data: 23 out of 25 participant have introduced themselves as of July 24, and I am the third one, in backward count.\r\n\r\nTo prove my statement, please, find the following *data visualisations*\r\n\r\n###Geography of M100 Potsdam 2014\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col0%2C+col1+from+11rvlchvj_GK6emh19Zw_Z4NwoyvdCOX4rb9p8B9l+limit+1000&amp;viz=HEATMAP&amp;h=true&amp;lat=50.14584851084825&amp;lng=49.76774834999992&amp;t=1&amp;z=4&amp;l=col0&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hmd=true&amp;hmg=%2366ff0000%2C%2393ff00ff%2C%23c1ff00ff%2C%23eeff00ff%2C%23f4e300ff%2C%23f4e300ff%2C%23f9c600ff%2C%23ffaa00ff%2C%23ff7100ff%2C%23ff3900ff%2C%23ff0000ff&amp;hmo=0.61&amp;hmr=24&amp;hmw=1&amp;hml=ONE_COL_LAT_LNG\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n###Age of participants\r\n\r\n<iframe height=371 width=600 src=\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IRKM3ZX5oQxPU6DD79v5CkxWYH1nt9Z_yl4FN4QOS74/gviz/chartiframe?oid=1780118024\" seamless frameborder=0 scrolling=no></iframe>\r\n\r\nNB The average for the group is 24.\r\n\r\nDear fellows and organisers, it is very honourable for me to be part of this team and to be able to participate in the event ahead of us! Thank you for choosing me.\r\n\r\nSo, let me finally introduce myself. My name is **Krystina Shveda** and I am from Belarus. That would be way too bold to call myself a data journalist so far, although I am really passionate about data-driven storytelling, visualisations and open data. Working as a journalist (read: idler) among thousands of programmers for three years led me to a point when I wanted to mix up those two professions and the two communities. The result is a Hacks/Hackers Minsk group that is pretty small but I hope to be able to develop it further. In September however, I am heading to London to start Master studies of Interactive Journalism at City University London. My nearest goal is to learn to use data tools and data understanding to create valuable and insightful stories and that is why I am eager to meet all of you and experiment together.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
